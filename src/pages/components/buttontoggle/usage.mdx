### Destructive
Used for buttons that perform a destructive action.

## Sizes

### Small
Limit use of this size and do not mix with other sizes. Reserved mostly for smaller components such as complex menus that appear on hover or click.

Buttons can contain text, an icon, or a combination of both. If text an an icon are present, the icon should always be to the left.
