## Styles

The most commonly used button style. Used in most situations where this is not the primary action on the page and it is not destructive.

`<Button.Primary />`
Used for the button that performs the primary action for the page (ex: Save). Try to limit to one primary button per a screen.

`<Button.Destructive />`
Used for buttons that perform a destructive action.

## Sizes
All button styles come in 3 sizes:

### Default
Most commonly used size. Should be used for all primary tasks.
### Small
Limit use of this size and do not mix with other sizes. Reserved mostly for smaller components such as complex menus that appear on hover or click.
### Large
Limited for actions that need emphasis. Good for empty state views. Should not be used for most primary actions.
