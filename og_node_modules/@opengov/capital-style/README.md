# Capital Style
This is a central place for storing and documenting design decisions in atomic style. This resource is primarily *design tokens* that can be exported to SASS, JSON, and CSS Modules.

You can see all of the token on this Github Page:

https://opengov.github.io/Capital-Style/

## Using this Library
This is a private library that can be pulled into our Zeus or ComposeApp frontend applications.

Install the package:

```npm install --save capital-style```

Import the tokens into your Sass:
```@import “~@opengov/capital-style/scss/capital”;```

Then you can reference any of the tokens using SASS variables. For example, to make a link OpenGov blue, write a style like this:

```color: $color-primary-selection;```

Import the tokens into your JS (not all tokens are available, if you need tokens for JS that aren't available please create a PR):
```var tokens = require('~@opengov/capital-style/css/capital.css');```

## Using Javascript tokens and functions

```
import { vizColors } from '@opengov/capital-style/js';
import { getVizColors } from '@opengov/capital-style/js';
```


## Adding New Tokens
Design and style tokens are found in the Tokens folder and are written in SASS.

The tokens are grouped by category, such as color.

**Don't forget to update ```docs/index.html``` whenever you update tokens and run `yarn run docs` before creating your PR!***
